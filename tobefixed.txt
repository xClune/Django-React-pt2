# Gym Planner App

To implement:
    - edit card
    - switch to hamburger menu button on phone screen
    - register/login errors => from error alerts to user readable on browser
    - styling on category headers
    - drag and drop?
    - exercise data structure => {exercise: text validate?, sets: number, reps: number}
    - storage for completed workouts? loop through completed workout and add exercises to new database

Bugs to be fixed:
    Serious:
        - (FIXED) Under 4 headers on full screen ruins display, notelist enters a different grid column from the header. 

    Small:
        - cards can partially overlap new workout form on hover
