# Gym Planner App

Currently: 
    - 

To implement:
    - register/login errors => from error alerts to user readable on browser
    - styling on category headers
    - drag and drop? dnd-kit || beautiful-dnd
    - exercise data structure => 
    {exercise: text validate?, sets: number, reps: number}
    - storage for completed workouts? loop through completed workout and add exercises to new database
    - icon selector for headers
    - make home page and move noteslist to separate page

Implemented:
    - edit card
    - switch to hamburger menu button on phone screen


Bugs to be fixed:
    Urgent:
        - 
    Moderate:
        - Form reset shouldn't go through fields individually
    Low:
        - cards can partially overlap new workout form on hover
        - helmet issue

Resolved:
    - (FIXED) Under 4 headers on full screen ruins display, notelist enters a   different grid column from the header. 
    (SOLUTION): div arrangement, moved header one level down

    - (FIXED) hide info again on mouseout of card
    (SOLUTION): added state change on mouseLeave.

    - (FIXED) poor hover effect on svg log
    (SOLUTION): moved 'group' to higher left increasing target size
