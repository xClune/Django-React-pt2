# Gym Planner App

To implement:
    - edit card
    - switch to hamburger menu button on phone screen
    - register/login errors => from error alerts to user readable on browser
    - styling on category headers
    - drag and drop?
    - exercise data structure => {exercise: text validate?, sets: number, reps: number}
    - storage for completed workouts? loop through completed workout and add exercises to new database
    - icon selector for headers
    - make home page and move noteslist to separate page

Bugs to be fixed:
    Urgent:
        - 

    Moderate:
        - Form reset shouldn't go through fields individually
    Low:
        - cards can partially overlap new workout form on hover


Resolved:
    - (FIXED) Under 4 headers on full screen ruins display, notelist enters a   different grid column from the header. 
    (SOLUTION): div arrangement, moved header one level down

    - (FIXED) hide info again on mouseout of card
    (SOLUTION): added state change on mouseLeave.
